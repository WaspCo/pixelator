# Pixelator

This is a small program which can blur and pixelate images to give them a "8bits" appearance.

To do:
- Support for compressed image format
- Support for video file
- Optimize the speed, add a speed factor (color less accurate but process faster)
- add temporal inertia for color blocks as parameter
